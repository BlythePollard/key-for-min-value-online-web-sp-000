# prereqs: iterators, hashes, conditional logic
# Given a hash with numeric values, return the key for the smallest value

#key--name
#value--number


def key_for_min_value(name_hash)
  lowest_value = nil #do I need to say = nil?
  lowest_key = nil
  name_hash.each do |key, value| #pulls each key and each value from hash
    if value < | ~= lowest_value #if value on this iteration is less than last lowest value
      value = lowest_value #make that lowest value the new lowest value
end
return lowest_value
end
end

#What could we use to compare each value to?
#Should we maybe create some variables?
#What if you create two variables to keep track of the lowest key, and lowest value? set them to something like nil - then when you loop over the hash, you can use those variables to compare with whatever key/value you're on now. If the new one is lower, assign it to that variable
